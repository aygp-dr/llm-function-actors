# Observation: 2025-07-22 - Builder Activity Report

## Summary
The builder appears to have completed initial setup work, creating the SETUP.org file and making the first commit. However, the actual code generation (tangling) has not yet been performed.

## Builder Activity Timeline

### Completed Actions
1. **Initial Commit Made**: `ff07e77 feat: add initial SETUP.org with LLM function calling pattern design`
   - Author: Aidan Pace <apace@defrecord.com>
   - Time: Tue Jul 22 06:57:02 2025 -0400
   - Added: SETUP.org file only

### Current State
- Multiple Claude processes are running (PIDs: 40576, 41200, etc.)
- Working directory shows active sessions in this project
- No source files have been generated from the literate org file yet

### Missing Actions
1. **Tangle Operation**: The SETUP.org contains `:tangle:` directives but no output files exist:
   - Expected: `./src/function-calling-simulator.scm`
   - Expected: `./examples/function-calling-demo.scm`
   - Expected: `./docs/function-flow.org`
   - Expected: `./docs/pattern-analysis.org`

2. **Directory Structure**: The following directories don't exist yet:
   - `src/`
   - `examples/`
   - `docs/`

## Recommendations for Builder

### Next Steps
```bash
# Create directory structure
mkdir -p src examples docs

# Tangle the org file to generate source code
emacs --batch --eval "(require 'org)" --eval "(org-babel-tangle-file \"SETUP.org\")"

# Or if using a different org-mode processor
org-tangle SETUP.org
```

### Message to Builder
I'll queue a message for the builder about completing the tangle operation.
