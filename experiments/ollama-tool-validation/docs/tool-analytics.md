# Tool Usage Analytics

## Minimal Tool Set Coverage

Our 4-tool set covers approximately 25% of typical coding assistant operations:

### Included Operations
1. **read_file** - View existing code/documentation
2. **write_file** - Create/modify files
3. **list_files** - Navigate project structure  
4. **search_code** - Find patterns/implementations

### Common Operations NOT Included
- Execute commands (bash, make, etc.)
- Git operations (status, commit, push)
- Package management (npm, pip, etc.)
- Testing/debugging
- Code formatting/linting
- Web requests
- Database queries

## Comparison with Production Assistants

| Feature | Our Implementation | Claude Code | GitHub Copilot |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|----------------|
| File Read | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| File Write | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| File List | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Code Search | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Command Execution | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ |
| Git Integration | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Web Requests | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ |
| Multi-file Edit | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |

## Performance Metrics

Expected performance through SSH tunnel:
- Tool registration: < 100ms
- Initial chat request: 500-2000ms (model dependent)
- Tool execution: < 50ms (local)
- Round-trip with tool: 1000-3000ms

## Expansion Opportunities

Priority additions for broader coverage:
1. Command execution (controlled subprocess)
2. Git operations (status, diff, commit)
3. Multi-file operations (bulk edit/rename)
4. Simple web requests (fetch documentation)
