* Overview

This experiment mocks the LLM actor to demonstrate the control flow shown in the sequence diagram.
It simulates various scenarios including:

- Function call detection and execution
- Multi-step tool use
- Error handling
- Final answer generation

* Architecture

The mock LLM actor:
1. Receives prompts from the application actor
2. Analyzes intent (mocked with pattern matching)
3. Generates appropriate responses (function calls or final answers)
4. Handles the complete conversation flow

* Test Scenarios

** Scenario 1: Simple Calculation
User asks for a calculation, LLM calls calculator function.

** Scenario 2: File Operations
User asks to read/write files, LLM chains multiple file operations.

** Scenario 3: Error Handling
Test how the system handles function execution errors.

** Scenario 4: Direct Answer
User asks a question that doesn't require function calls.

* Implementation

See [[file:llm-actor-mock.scm][llm-actor-mock.scm]] for the implementation.
